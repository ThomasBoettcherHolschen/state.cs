# Welcome to state.cs

The current stable release is 1.4.3.

## Introduction
State.cs is a C# implementation of a state machine library that largely follows UML 2 state machine semantics. Given the need to make this an executable model, there are certain features that are not supported, please read [UML compliance](https://github.com/steelbreeze/state.cs/wiki/UML Compliance) for more information.

## Versioning
The versions are in the form {major}.{minor}.{build}
* Major changes introduce significant new behaviour and will update the public API.
* Minor changes introduce features, bug fixes, etc, but note that they also may break the public API.
* Build changes can introduce features, though usually are fixes and performance enhancements; these will never break the public API.

## Documentation
Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/steelbreeze/state.cs/wiki) for documentation.

## Building state.cs
Simply add all the .cs files and the resources to an existing or new assembly. That's it...
